<h3>Soft Skills</h3>

I sat in the grim silence of the stone as I sharpened my sword. A cold wind blew in from the open doorway behind me, and despite myself and my armor, I shivered. I shuffled slightly closer to the makeshift campfire I sat next to, and as I felt the friction of the whetstone upon my blade, I shifted my eyes to the man sitting across the fire. The lithe man in the robes of the Church seemed to notice my gaze, and gave me a look that said “Well, what is it?” He waited for me to speak, and I did. 
“You have anything to say, holy man?” My voice, like glass crunching beneath a metal boot, echoed from beneath my armor. 
<br> <br> “Why?” He asked, in a soft, bemused tone, nearly the direct opposite of my own. “What is there to say?”<br> <br> 
<br> <br> “Well,” I continued, “a lot of people seem to think what’s going on outside is the Church’s fault. You have anything to say about that?”<br> <br> 
He idly tilted his head from side to side, thinking. “If my brothers and sisters in the Church were doing anything…untoward with their magic, then I swear to you, Sir Knight,” he steadied himself and looked at my helmet, in lieu of looking me in the eye. “It was completely unknown to me.”
“Mhm,” was all I said. Church men lie - I knew that well enough. No use arguing the point here and now. The traitors can be impaled later. For now, I just needed to survive - to fix things. I looked down at my sword again, and gave the whetstone another pull, drawing it against the metal. I flipped it in my hand, and began to sharpen the other side. I looked back at the priest, who had since begun to read from a loose collection of documents that he apparently kept on his person.
“You all can do magic, then? The priests?” I pocketed the whetstone. My sword was as sharp as it could be, for now.
<br> <br> The priest looked up from his papers and smiled at me, halfway between pleasant surprise and unbearable arrogance. “Oh, yes, Sir Knight. We are quite skilled, myself included.”
“Good,” I grumbled, rising from my sitting position, my metal armor clunking and clicking as the different pieces interlocked and shifted. “We will need it. We are moving. There is a settlement to the north called Granary that perseveres in spite of what has been wrought - we are going there.”
“Damn,” Said the priest, sighing in faux-annoyance, “and here I was getting used to slowly starving to death in a cold stone prison. Very well!” Cheerfully, he tossed the documents into the fire and sprung to his feet.
<br> <br> Slowly, I looked at the now smoldering papers, then back to him. “Do you not...need those?”<br> <br> 
The priest chuckled heartily. “What, those old things? No, those were just my prayers and hymns. Not of much use to us now, eh? Better to not weigh me down.”
I made a noise of vague approval, and then kicked the fire out before continuing out the stone doorway, the priest following closely behind me.
I’d think that after a few months I’d get used to the sight of the abomination in our sky. I still haven’t. I still remember the time when you couldn’t look directly at the sun without straining your eyes. Now, you can. Because the sun isn’t there anymore. In its place is a hollow black sphere lined with roiling purple fire. It’s as though someone had plucked the sun from the heavens, and what remains is its terrible outline, casting doom instead of light over our heads. The false-sun doesn’t move, simply remaining fixed in our sky like a nail driven into a board, tinting the whole sky a violent shade of violet. Only a selected few learned men, with their timepieces, can track the passage of time now - the rest of us have been damned to an impossibly long and awful day with no end in sight.
The purple light shimmered at our backs as the priest and I made our way out of the ruin we were staying in, taking a makeshift path through a grassy clearing that, up ahead, seemed to lead into a forest. The priest cleared his throat, and internally I braced myself for more conversation from him.
“Sir Knight,” he began, “are you a particularly religious man, you would say?”
I kept walking for a bit as I thought over his question. How could I have faith, in these circumstances? How could I hold out hope for the gods to save us? I can’t. Such thinking could and would get me killed. All I can rely on is myself, nothing more.
“No.” I eventually answered, at the edge of the forest. It was dark in there, but all that meant was that the rays of the false-sun were mercifully blocked by the many tree leaves and branches. I kept walking, and the priest continued talking.
“You know, Sir Knight, there are many who consider what’s happening to be some kind of trial or test by the gods. They believe that, after a certain period of time, the gods themselves will descend and make their final judgment of humanity regarding our actions during this crisis.”
“Hm,” I said, my metal boots crunching sticks and foliage beneath me, “that’s stupid.”
“Quite right!” said the priest. “Just between you and me, Sir Knight, it’s my personal belief that’s all come and gone, essentially. We’ve already experienced the judgment of the gods, and this,” he gestured upwards towards the false-sun, “is simply the aftermath.”
I chose not to deign the priest’s theorizing with a reply, so I simply continued walking. Barring our way forward were a thick tangle of nested thorny vines, so I drew my backup knife and began to slowly and steadily cut my way through them, the priest following behind through the openings I cut. Despite my best efforts not to engage him in conversation, he piped up again.
“My name is Lucian, by the way.”
I stopped cutting for a moment and turned to look at him. Lucian…had I heard that name before? Maybe, once or twice, before the sun left our sky, but nothing substantial that I could remember. Still, it was good to know his name. I nodded and turned to get back to cutting.
“Are you not going to tell me your name, Sir Knight?” called out the priest.
I thought about it. It’d be a gamble, for sure. Powerful mages can do dangerous things with people’s names, and holy men are no exception. I mean, I barely know this man. For all I know, he could be one of the bastards who instigated this whole mess. I decided against it.
“No.” I responded curtly, and continued to cut a path forward.
Lucian, for his part, sighed dramatically. “Oh, Sir Knight, you are such a stunning conversationalist!”
“I - am - perfectly - pleasant - to - talk - to!” I punctuated my annoyed words between cuts through the vines. Once more, I halted my task and looked back at him over my shoulder. “I am just a practical man, Lucian. I do not care for debates regarding the nature of one’s situation. I much prefer to simply do something about it, instead. If a bunch of renegade mages - Church men or not - have stolen your sun and plunged your world into a seemingly infinite age of darkness and monsters, then my method is to fix it. Put back the sun, if we can, and if we can’t then I guess we just kill all the monsters. Make people safe. And when that’s done, we behead everyone responsible. That make sense to you, Lucian?”
He sighed again, then raised his hands in mock-surrender. “I suppose, Sir Knight. You needn’t trouble yourself with my words any longer. I will remain mercifully quiet.” He smiled at me again in that particularly irritating way of his, but I tried not to let it get to me, and continued onward through the vines.
Eventually, the vines and our path led us to a surprisingly large clearing in the forest, the top of it covered by a thick bramble of tree branches. Ahead, beyond the clearing, lay the further path, towards Granary. I sheathed my knife and kept walking. Lucian seemed to enjoy the peacefulness of this place in the middle of the forest - but that was quickly disturbed.
As we reached the center of the clearing, the ground suddenly began to shake underneath us. I swiftly took a step backwards, drawing my greatsword from its sheath on my back. I knew what this was, and I dreaded it.
	In the scant few moments I had before it arrived, I turned to face Lucian. I placed the hand not holding my greatsword on his shoulder. I hadn’t noticed before just how large I was compared to him, my hand able to grip his entire shoulder with complete ease. I had barely any time to register that before I spoke, however.
	“Try and stay low to the ground, and out of sight. It’ll be here any second.”
His eyes went wide with recognition. “You mean..?” 
I nodded. “Darkbeast.”
The rumbling of the ground reached a fever pitch, and as Lucian scampered off somewhere, I turned to face it. The floor of the clearing itself cracked open, as something burst out from beneath it. 
While the removal of the sun was an atrocity of magic, and the constancy of day put stress on everyone, these beings were the true danger. With the loss of the sun, some manner of inherent magical safeguard seemed to have been removed as well, and all manner of dangerous creatures manifested. The first manifestations, in the days after the vanishing of the sun, were the worst. Hundreds died. The streets ran red with blood as someone, anyone tried to figure out what was going on. We took to calling the creatures Darkbeasts, due to the timing of their arrival. 
Thankfully, the one that now stood before me seemed to be one of the less-dangerous types. It was animalistic, almost resembling a wolf with its claws and sharpened teeth and long, black fur that floated in the air as if submerged in water. Gods help me if it was one of the more human-like ones. The Beast looked down at me with one massive red eye, and snarled. I raised my sword.
In one fluid motion, the creature bore down upon me, swiping its claws. I was too slow to block it with my sword, but thankfully my armor took most of the damage. I was still knocked back a short distance by the impact, but I managed to quickly regain my footing and charged, greatsword raised. 
The Beast tried to dodge, but my blade sunk deep into its fur, spilling out dark, ichorous blood that ran down the length of my sword. It howled in pain, and bound away to the other side of the clearing, staring me down.
It snapped its jaws at me a few times and continued to stare. I looked back cautiously. Was the thing preparing to charge me again? I took a defensive stance, just in case. Suddenly, the Beast’s massive red eye began to glow with an energy I was able to recognize as magic. Shit. I didn’t think it’d be powerful enough to utilize magical attacks. 
I unfortunately realized that just a second too late, as the Beast shot out from its eye a burning red blast of magical energy that careened towards me.
I didn’t have the time to avoid the blast, so I braced myself and hoped my armor would absorb most of the damage once more. However, just as it was about to impact me, I saw something - it was Lucian, sprinting towards me as fast as he could. As he ran, light blue magical energy coalesced around his arms, and he dove in front of the Beast’s blast.
The energy around Lucian’s arms formed into a shield, and as the blast impacted it, instead of exploding or otherwise hurting Lucian, it simply dissipated, like it never even existed. With a wave of his hand, Lucian’s shield dissolved, and he turned to look at me. “You alright?” He asked, in a surprisingly caring tone. I gave him a nod, and he smiled.
“Good. Now, I shall stun the Beast, and you will finish him off. Sound like a plan, Sir Knight?”
“Aye.” I said, and hefted my sword to prepare to charge. As I did, I saw magical energy, purple this time, begin to course around Lucian’s arms, like arcing electricity. I started running towards the Beast. I just needed one good strike on its eye, and I could end this. It roared as I approached, and internally I began to worry. If Lucian was going to do something, he had to do it now.
Suddenly, as if in response to my doubt, a purple bolt of lightning shot out from over my head, and struck into the Beast’s head, causing it to howl in pain and fall to the ground, wounded but not dead. In my mind I thanked Lucian as I plunged my sword into the monster’s still-open eye, and it let out a terrible, almost pitiful screech as it finally perished.
I stood there for a moment, catching my breath. I had gotten exceedingly lucky. The Beast itself wasn’t one of the dangerous kind, and if I hadn’t had Lucian’s help…it might’ve gotten bad. I pulled my sword out, now covered in the thing’s thick, oily blood. Damn. I’d have to clean it later. I stuck it into the ground, not wanting to stain my sheath.
At that point, Lucian had made his way over to me. He looked at me expectantly. “Well? Was that practical enough for you, Sir Knight?”
I gave a nod of approval. “Quite. Your help was invaluable, Lucian. Thank you.”
He smiled at that, a genuine one instead of his usual smug grin, and bowed. “I’m glad to hear you think that I’m of some use, at least.”
As we made preparations to leave and continue on our journey towards Granary, something caught my eye near the Beast’s corpse. In the middle of its eye, where I made the cut, surrounded by that black blood, was something shining. Against all my instincts, against all my better judgment, I reached out towards it. It was hard and small enough to grab, like a stone. When I pulled it out, that’s what it resembled - a small, rock-like formation. Maybe some kind of crystal or gem? I’m not well read enough to know, but what I could recognize was that the stone glowed - with a distant, yet familiar light.
“What…is this?” I wondered aloud.
Suddenly, I felt the presence of Lucian next to me. He said,“That, my friend, is a piece of the sun itself.”
He was smiling, still. It was all teeth.
“We have a lot of work to do, Sir Knight.”
