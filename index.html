Hello! My name is Benjamin Fine, and this is my portfolio. I am a 20 year old writer currently studying at Emerson College, majoring in Creative Writing. <br>
I enjoy both the fantasy and sci-fi genres, and have an interest in screenwriting. I also write short fiction! Read some of my stories below:
