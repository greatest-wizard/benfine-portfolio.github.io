<br> <br> The first thing I noticed was the light. <br> <br> Flat on my back, I squinted, my eyes adjusting to the buzzing fluorescent beam that laid overhead. Slowly, mechanically, I sat up, rising from a large metal slab. My limbs ached. Something inside me felt wrong - as though I were taken apart, piece by piece, and put back together again. But something’s in the wrong place, like a clock that ticked out of time. The failure of a watchmaker. As a wave of nausea passed through me, I looked around to try and better see where exactly I was.
The room itself was small, enclosed. Most everything was made of metal, rusted over with time. A pane of frosted glass was bolted into the wall in front of me. Around the room were scattered various mechanical parts, only a few of which I was able to recognize. A hand. A leg. What looked like a bisected heart. I looked up again, back into the buzzing light, and realized that surrounding it were a variety of tools on the ends of spindly robotic arms, again, only few I recognized. A blowtorch. A surgical knife. A buzzsaw, covered in some strange burnt-orange liquid.
Suddenly, thoughts rose to the top of my head, accompanied by another wave of nausea and a spike of pain behind my eyes. How do I know these things? How do I know anything? Where am I? Who am I? Panic rising, I tried to remember anything beyond me waking up in this room. Nothing. I started to shake, and my breathing became ragged and quick. 
I scrambled off the slab, desperate to run, to escape, to get myself anywhere but here. I tumbled to the floor, clanging against the rusted tiling. At the height of my delirium, I saw it - printed onto the section of floor I looked down at, in neat golden text, the words appeared.
<br> <br> <i>“A self.”</i> <br> <br> 
I snapped out of my panic out of sheer bewilderment. My breathing slowed, and I stared curiously at the text. As if in response, more text blinked into existence underneath it.
<br> <br> <i>“You need a self, my friend. Self-image. The rest will follow.”</i> <br> <br>
“What?” I questioned aloud, and my voice shocked me. I don’t know why, but it sounded wrong. Chopped up and filtered, like I was behind a mask. More questions arrived in my head now, like unwanted guests. What language am I even speaking? What is a language? How do I even know what speech is? This time, however, I pushed the questions back where they came, and gazed curiously down at the text again as the previous message disappeared, before another took its place.
<br> <br> <i>“Follow me.”</i> <br> <br> 
The end of the ‘e’ in ‘follow me’ suddenly began to elongate, pointing towards the corner of the room where a puddle of some oily liquid congealed. Steadily, I rose to my feet and followed the line. Below the puddle, another message.
<br> <br> <i>“Look inside.”</i> <br> <br> 
Seeing as it was able to bring me out of whatever it was I was going through moments ago, I decided to trust the message. I kneeled down and bent forward to look at the puddle. There, I saw myself reflected. Two yellow eyes, bright like searchlights, stared back at me. My skin was silvery and chrome, not rusted like the metal that surrounds me. I had no visible mouth, ears, or nose. I looked down at my own body now. It matched my face, all smooth metal and small yellow lights. Where my joints should be, I had interlocking mechanisms of steel - I was reminded of a bug’s carapace. They clicked softly when I moved them.
I looked back to the message, realizing it had changed while I was inspecting my body.
<br> <br> <i>“Feeling better?”</i> <br> <br> 
I thought about that. In the few seconds since I saw myself, the questions already seemed quieter. As if now they were less important, a lower priority. I certainly felt better - more sure. I knew who I was.
“Yes,” I said, still trying to get used to the sound of my voice,“thank you. Um. What or who are you, exactly?”
The text vanished for a few moments longer, deliberating on its answer.
<br> <br> <i>“I am your Thread. I am here to guide you out of this place.”</i> <br> <br> 
I opted for pretending as though this made any sense to me at all. “I see. And where is ‘this place’, exactly?”
<br> <br> <i>“This place is, in order: A laboratory, a prison, a test, a sacred grove, a graveyard, a purgatory, a deathtrap, a punishment, a metaphor, a nest, a congregation, a culmination, a victory, a defeat, a house, a sacrificial altar-” </i> <br> <br> 
The text, or, Thread as it named itself, kept writing, and writing, and writing, until eventually it shifted around and began writing over itself until the words were entirely illegible. I watched in equal fascination and horror. Could I really trust this thing? Could it really be my guide? But, as I am finding myself needing to do with increasing frequency, I pushed the questions aside and called out to the Thread.
“Okay! Okay. I think I understand. Please, if you can help me escape, then lead the way.”
The mountain of text vanished then, thankfully. I let out a sigh of relief with the mouth I didn’t have.
<br> <br> <i>“Of course.”</i> <br> <br> 
As it did before, the Thread began drawing a line towards a door on the far end of the room that I neglected to notice before. I followed it dutifully. As I pressed my hands up against the door, however, I hesitated. My doubts returned. Was I really going to put my faith in this mysterious text that I barely knew anything about and couldn’t even tell me where I was? I looked back at the room behind me and sighed again. I don’t really have a choice, do I? I pushed on the doors. Time to get moving.
As I did, a terrible pain overwhelmed my entire body. I didn’t even have time to scream before my vision was overtaken by static. In the depths of my agony, I saw something - a vision, or perhaps a prophecy.

<br> <br> “A porcelain teacup was dropped from a great and mighty height and shattered into a million pieces. This happened again and again, over and over for billions of years. It only stopped when eventually, the pile of porcelain shards had grown so high that from the place the cup was dropped, it could simply be placed atop it.”<br> <br> 

When I came to again, I was walking down a dark and narrow hallway surrounded on all sides by, naturally, rusted metal. The Thread’s line trailed lazily alongside me. 
The hallway had no windows or doors to speak of, so the only light was that ones came from my own eyes and the various smaller lights running along the length of my body. It was enough to see about a foot in front of me, but not much else.
I paused for a moment and clutched the side of the wall. Thankfully, when I returned from the vision the pain was gone, but I couldn’t help but start to puzzle over its meaning. I stopped myself. If I had teeth, I would’ve grit them. I can’t spend all this time deliberating over the ‘how’s and ‘why’s. I have to get out of here. That’s all that matters right now. I kept walking, and the Thread followed.
“Thread,” I asked as we walked, my boredom now overtaking my desire to stay ignorant, “can I ask you another question?”
<br> <br> <i>“You do. Go ahead.” </i> It replied. <br> <br> 
“Do you know who I am?”
The Thread seemed to think about that for a moment, allowing its line to angle itself into a few different shapes as we walked, a variety of angular, geometric patterns. Eventually, it reformed itself and answered.
<br> <br> <i>“Yes.”</i> It neglected to elaborate.
I kept walking, hoping my frustration was hidden. Clearly, this thing, whatever it was, knows a lot of things I don’t, and isn’t intent on sharing. That’s fine, I thought to myself - I’m not mad. I just need to get out of here. Questions can wait.
With alarming speed, the Thread’s message changed.
<br> <br> <i>“You’re going to want to take a step to your left.” </i> <br> <br> 
I stared at the message for a moment, wondering what could possibly cause such a sudden warning for the Thread, when ahead of me in the hallway I heard a terrible screeching sound, like metal grinding against metal, enough to kick up sparks. I decided to take that step to the left, and the Thread replied in kind.
<br> <br> <i>“Good. Now wait for it to pass.” </i>
Not wanting to raise further questions, I waited. One second. Two seconds. The metal screeching got louder, closer. Any minute now. Three seconds.
With blinding speed, something sprinted past me. It was fast enough that I only had time to see a massive blur of red and gray, vaguely in the shape of a human, speeding off into the darkness of the hallway.
It took me a moment to realize that even after the blur had left, I was still standing there, frozen in fear. I could feel a heart beating in my chest. Slowly, I looked back up towards the thread.
“What was that?” I asked, trying my best to keep my breathing steady.
<br> <br> <i>“The other variable. The beast. He will be upon you again soon. You should prepare.”</i>
I felt that same nausea rise in the back of my throat again, and did my best to continue on. Can’t be afraid. Can’t ask questions. Can’t stop moving. Just get out of here. Escape. Follow the Thread.
I kept walking for what felt like hours, but it could have been days. I had no way to keep track of time in the hallway. It stretched on, and on, and on.
Eventually, the Thread’s line stopped, and I stopped along with it. I stared at it, confused. This hadn’t happened before. Before, it had only done this when I asked it a question. Why had it stopped?
<br> <br> <i>“I have to tell you something.”</i><br> <br> 
I nodded. Okay, maybe that was good - if it was actually freely volunteering information to me, maybe it’d be something useful?
<br> <br> <i>“Your name is Ariadne.”</i><br> <br> 
“Ari..adne..?” I sounded it out, trying to get a feel for it. That was my name? It does seem strangely familiar. I looked at the Thread. “Is that who I am?”
<br> <br> <i>“It is not who you are, but it is what you are.”</i> <br> <br> 
More than a little fed up, I reached out and flicked the piece of wall on which the Thread remained. My chrome finger clanged against the rusted paneling. “Can’t you give me a straight answer for once?”
<br> <br> <i>“Yes. You should start running now. The beast has your scent.”</i> <br> <br> 
I clenched my hands. The Thread’s text faded, and the line suddenly shot off down the hallway at incredible speed. Through the darkness, I could see it glowing faintly, leading me onward. Attempting to steady myself, I started to run into the void. As I did, from far behind me, I heard him. That terrible metallic screech. <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept running.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got closer.
	 <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept running.
		<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got closer.
		  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept running.
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got closer.
<br> <br> Then, something terrible happened. I tripped.
One of the panels on the floor was looser than the others, and it sent me tumbling forward, over and over. I came to a slow stop, flat on my back. As I sat up, I realized something. He was standing over me.
I could see his form clearly now. He most closely resembled a man flayed, all exposed muscle and bone and blood. His lower jaw was removed, leaving a gaping cavity where his mouth would be. Every time he moved, his whole body shuddered, as though he was in deep pain. All throughout his form, metal wiring snaked through him, cords connecting to each other for some unknown purpose. On the top of his head, pieces of his skull were propped up on both ends by small metallic scaffolding, giving him the appearance of horns. Through all this mutilation, his eyes remained completely untouched, his burnt-orange stare boring into me. 
On his chest, I saw it - the Thread, displaying a message for me.
<br> <br> <i>“GET UP.”</i> <br> <br> 
I scrambled to my feet. The creature didn’t move as I did, opting to watch me with cautious eyes. I felt that heart in my chest again, beating rapidly - something resembling instinct fills me. Fight or flight. This thing will kill me if he can. That can’t happen.
Another message from the Thread, projected onto the wall next to me.
<br> <br> <i>“DODGE LEFT”</i> <br> <br> 
I did so just as the beast, with a guttural scream, flung out a hand towards where I once was. He impacted the air, but I could feel a small gust just from the force of him punching nothing. He was both stronger and faster than me. This is bad. Why am I doing this? Why am I not running?
I had no time to consider these questions, as another message appeared on the floor at my feet.
<br> <br> <i>“DUCK.”</i> <br> <br> 
I obeyed, and the monster was sent hurtling over my head as he completely missed a sudden lunge, and was sent tumbling to the ground, almost a mirror of my previous fall. Okay. Good. He may have the advantage, but I can trick him. I can dodge. I can bide my time, and I can strike. 
And then the Thread disappeared.
I felt like the air just got knocked out of me. Something was wrong. Something was terribly wrong.
“Thread! Thread!!” I called out, looking around frantically. Where did it go? It was my advantage, my way out, my guide! I looked back down the hallway I came from. Maybe the line was there? But no. Nothing. The only light in the hallway now was from me. I felt despair overtake me, and I felt like crying. Can I cry? Is that something my eyes can do?
I only realized I had forgotten the circumstances of my situation when I felt the monster’s fist pierce my abdomen.
I could hear his breath, now, so very close to me. His fist had punched a hole in me, and from it, burnt-orange liquid poured out. Oh, I thought. Is this my blood? He removed his fist from my insides, and I crumpled to the ground, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.
As my blood pooled around me, the last thing I saw was the beast standing over me. He reached down, grabbed my face.
<br> <br> And as he crushed my skull, I shattered - into a million porcelain pieces.
